## Summary

  It is undeniable that action games are still a hit up to this day, it is a reliable fact that gameplay is a core of the games, yes graphics can enhance the game
  however just a reminder that fidelity and design are two different things the game can have a great graphical fidelity but with a generic artstyle and can still fail
  however if the game has a lower fidelity but have a more impactful artstyle that can capture the audience, it will perform better.
  
  If the gameplay doesn't hold up and is not fun the player base will not last. In order to have a lasting community your game need to have an unforgettable art style and great gameplay.
